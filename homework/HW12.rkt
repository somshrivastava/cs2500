;; 1. Do not create, modify or delete any line that begins with ";;!". These are
;;    markers that we use to segment your file into parts to facilitate grading.
;; 2. You must follow the _design recipe_ for every problem. In particular,
;;    every function you define must have at least three check-expects (and
;;    more if needed).
;; 3. You must follow the Style Guide:
;;    https://pages.github.khoury.northeastern.edu/2500/2024F/style.html
;; 4. You must submit working code. In DrRacket, ensure you get no errors
;;    when you click Run. After you submit on Gradescope, you'll get instant
;;    feedback on whether or not Gradescope can run your code, and your code must
;;    run on Gradescope to receive credit from the autograder.
;; 5. On some problems, you can get automated feedback on your in-progress work
;;    from FeedBot, a system developed by the course staff. When you submit your
;;    assignment, you will see a link to the FeedBot report along with the autograder
;;    feedback. Only a certain number of submissions will get this, and submissions
;;    close together will not receive the feedback.

;;! HW12

;; In this assignment, you'll be writing a big-bang program that requests information
;; from a server in order to display information about the happiness of neighborhoods
;; based on interviews conducted with residents. A user will be able to interact with
;; the final project by moving forwards and backwards in time to see how subjective
;; metrics of happiness have changed over the years.

;; The following resources may be helpful:
;; - Client-Server Architecture
;; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggp5C1q0gNA

;; - The World is Not Enough
;; https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpuniverse.html#(part._universe._world2)

;; Our concept of happiness in this assignment is based on the World Happiness Report,
;; a global partnership between Gallup, Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, UN Sustainable
;; Development Solutions Network, and the WHRâ€™s Editorial Board that uses observed data
;; on six variables to explain the differences in life evaluations (happiness) across
;; regions. You can find more information about the World Happiness Report here:
;; https://worldhappiness.report/

;; Since we want to communicate with a server to request data, this big-bang
;; program will behave a bit differently than big-bang programs you've seen before.
;; You've seen before that big-bang accepts handlers that describe how the state
;; changes over time (on-tick) and that describe how the change changes
;; with user input. These functions take in the current state and produce a new
;; one.
;;
;; In this HW, we similarly define handlers that describe how the state
;; changes, but since we'd like to additionally communicate with the server to
;; request data, the signatures of the handlers are a bit different, as to allow
;; the handlers to say "I'd like to update the state, but also please send this message
;; to the server". This gives us the ability to send messages to the server, but we'd
;; also like to update the state when we eventually receive responses: we can use
;; the big-bang `on-receive` handler for this purpose.

;;! Problem 1

;; First, we'll need a world state to contain the information we'll need to keep
;; track of for this assignment. In Problem 2D, you will create an updated data definition, but
;; to start, we'll keep it simple by tracking just the number of years into the
;; future we are currently displaying. The "base year" for this assignment is 2020.

;; A ClientWorld is a (make-cw Integer)
(define-struct cw [yearsahead])

;; A ClientWorld represents the current state of the happiness simulation.
;; It contains the following information:
;; - yearsahead: the current number of years after 2020 being rendered

(define (cw-temp cw)
  (... (cw-yearsahead cw) ...))

;; You will also need the following simplified data definition of a Neighborhood.
;; The examples and template have been emitted for brevity.

;; A Neighborhood is one of:
;; - "Allston"
;; - "Back Bay"
;; - "Bay Village"
;; - "Beacon Hill"
;; - "Brighton"
;; - "Charlestown"
;; - "Chinatown"
;; - "Dorchester"
;; - "Downtown"
;; - "East Boston"
;; - "Fenway-Kenmore"
;; - "Hyde Park"
;; - "Jamaica Plain"
;; - "Mattapan"
;; - "Mission Hill"
;; - "North End"
;; - "Roslindale"
;; - "Roxbury"
;; - "South Boston"
;; - "South End"
;; - "West End"
;; - "West Roxbury"
;; - "Wharf District"
;; Interpretation: represents one of the 23 neighborhoods in Boston

;;! Part A

;; Define a constant, `EX-CW`, that represents a ClientWorld 5 years in the future.

;;!! IMPORTANT: Write your response BELOW this line:

(define EX-CW (make-cw 5))

;;! Part B

;; To communicate with the server, your client will send and recieve messages in
;; a specific format. Requests from the client to the server are called packages
;; (https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpuniverse.html#%28def._universe._%28%28lib._2htdp%2Funiverse..rkt%29._make-package%29%29),
;; and consist of two fields:
;; - the WorldState of the client (in the Racket documentation, `w`)
;; - an S-Expression (see below) representing the message (in the Racket documentation, `m`)

;; An S-Expression is one of:
;; - Number
;; - String
;; - [ListOf S-Expression]
;; S-Expressions are a data format that can include numbers, strings, lists,
;; and arbitrarily nested combinations of these.

(define EX-SEXP1 2020)
(define EX-SEXP2 "Hello, World!")

    (cond
      [(number? sexp) ... sexp ...]
      [(string? sexp) ... sexp ...]
      [(list? sexp) (... (list-temp sexp) ...)]))

;; The requests our client will make for this program are very simple: they are numbers,
;; representing the year that the client wants to request data from. Note that this
;; value is absolute, in contrast to the `yearsahead` field (which is relative to 2020).
;; Using your ClientWorld (`EX-CW`) from Part A, define three Package constants `PACKAGE-2025`, `PACKAGE-2035`,
;; and `PACKAGE-2040` that represent requests for happiness data from 2025, 2035, and 2040 respectively.

(define PACKAGE-2035 (make-package EX-CW 2035))

;;! Part C

;; Now, design a key handler that handles arrow key presses by incrementing or
;; decrementing the ClientWorld's current year by `YEAR-INCR`. When the year is
;; incremented, the key handler should return a package requesting happiness data
;; for the new year. The year should only be increment up to `MAXYEAR`, or decremented
;; to `BASEYEAR`. If the correct key is not pressed, or the next year would be out
;; of bounds, this function should simply return the current world state.

;; Write the implementation and tests for `key-handler`. The signature and purpose statement
;; have been given. The `|` indicates that the function returns a package _or_ a ClientWorld.

(define MAXYEAR 3000)

(define YEAR-INCR 10)

;; key-handler : ClientWorld KeyEvent -> Package | ClientWorld
;; If right/left arrow key is pressed, updates the state with a new year and returns

;;! Problem 2

;; The server contains information gathered from surveys about the self-reported happiness
;; of residents in each neighborhood in Boston. The survey asks questions on the
;; following topics:

;; 1. Social Support
;; If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on
;; to help you whenever you need them, or not?
;; Possible responses: "Yes" or "No"

;; 2. Freedom to Make Life Choices
;; Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you
;; do with your life?
;; Possible responses: "S" or "D"

;; 3. Positive Affect
;; Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?
;; Did you experience enjoyment during the majority of the day yesterday?
;; Did you learn or do something interesting yesterday?
;; Range of responses: an integer aggregating responses to the above questions ranging 0-10

;; For each neighborhood, the server returns a collection of survey information
;; in the following form:

#;(list "Allston"
        (list (list "Yes" "Yes" "No" "Yes" "No" "No" "Yes" "No")
              (list "S" "S" "D" "S" "D" "D" "S" "D")
              (list 8 7 9 6 4 5 7 6)))

;;! Part A

;; Collecting data such as this is important to understand the mental
;; well-being of people in different neighborhoods, and it could be used
;; effectively to decide where to, e.g., deploy more public resources that may
;; at least partly contribute positively towards these metrics (e.g., more
;; parks, better social services, etc).
;;
;; However, it is also possible that the data could also contribute negatively
;; to existing stereotypes that certain neighborhoods are "less happy" than
;; others. This is a problem because while "happiness" sounds like an internal,
;; innate property, many of the actual metrics might actually be caused by
;; external circumstances.
;;
;; Please give an example of a external circumstance that could contribute to someone
;; reporting a low or negative score on one of the metrics below, but that is
;; out of the control of the person.
;;
;;
;;!! IMPORTANT: Write your response BELOW this line:

#|

An example of an external circumstance is economic hardship because of limited job opportunities
in the neighborhood. If the area suffers from high unemployment rates, individuals may not like the
level of freedom they have to make life choices. This lack of control can lead to negative responses.

|#

;;! Part B

;; Consider the following data definition:

(define-struct hi [neighborhood support freedom affect])

;; Interpretation: represents responses to a survey about the subjective wellbeing of residents
;; in a neighborhood.
