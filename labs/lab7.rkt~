;; Boston Potholes

;; Consider “Street Bump,” a project by the city of Boston to crowdsource data on potholes
;; (https://www.boston.gov/transportation/street-bump). The smartphone app automatically detects
;; potholes using data from the smartphone’s sensors and sends the data to the city. For our
;; purposes, we will represent the data gathered on a drive using the following data definitions:

(define-struct pothole [x y size urgent?])
;; A Pothole is a (make-pothole Decimal Decimal Decimal Boolean)
;; Interpretation: a datapoint collected about a pothole measuring the pothole's latitudinal and
;; longitudinal position, size (diameter in feet), and whether repairs are urgently needed.

;; Note: you can use the following website to explore the latitude and longitudes of each
;; pothole: https://www.latlong.net/

(define POTHOLE-EX-1 (make-pothole 42.3491 -71.0417 2 #true))
(define POTHOLE-EX-2 (make-pothole 42.3555 -71.0566 0.7 #false))
(define POTHOLE-EX-3 (make-pothole 42.3497 -71.0797 4 #true))
(define POTHOLE-EX-4 (make-pothole 42.3650 -71.0543 1.2 #true))

(define (pothole-temp pd)
  (... (pothole-x pd) ... (pothole-y pd) ... (pothole-size pd) ... (pothole-urgent? pd) ...))

;; A DriveData is one of:
;; - '()
;; - (cons Pothole DriveData)
;; Interpretation: a collection of informatation about potholes collected on a drive.

(define DD-EX-1 '())
(define DD-EX-2 (cons POTHOLE-EX-2 (cons POTHOLE-EX-1 '())))
(define DD-EX-3
  (cons POTHOLE-EX-4 (cons POTHOLE-EX-3 (cons POTHOLE-EX-2 (cons POTHOLE-EX-1 DD-EX-1)))))

;;! Part A

;; Write a function called `urgent-potholes`, which consumes a DriveData and returns a DriveData with
;; all the urgent potholes.

;;! Part B

;; INTERPRETIVE QUESTIONS
;; -- Consider the fact that our measure of "urgency" is a Boolean. It seems as though urgency
;; being "True" or "False" doesn't actually provide much valuable information. For example, imagine
;; you're trying to create an order in which to repair potholes around Boston. However, we might have
;; tens or hundreds of potholes that are all merely marked "Urgent," and we would have no way to
;; meaningfully rank them. Propose another field to measure the urgency of a pothole's repair. How
;; will this field be calculated? In 2-3 sentences, explain why your proposal effectively captures the
;; idea of "urgency."

;; When Street Bump was an active initiative from 2011-2014, people making <$30,000/year
;; were around half as likely to own a smartphone that could download the Street Bump app
;; (https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2011/07/11/overview-of-smartphone-adoption/).
;; Smartphone ownership is still skewed across socioeconomic lines
;; (https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/?tabItem=64e32376-5a21-4b1d-8f8b-5f92406db984).
;; In 2-3 sentences, explain how Street Bump may have worsened existing inequalities in Boston's
;; infrastructure.

;; Estimated Portion of Lab: 10%


;;! Part C

;; After seeing this data, the city of Boston decides to allocate additional resources to fix the
;; potholes. They need to determine the quantity of cement they will need to fix the potholes.
;; Write a function called total-pothole-size, which consumes a DriveData and returns the sum
;; of the diameters (in feet) of all of the potholes.

;; Estimated Portion of Lab: 20%


;;! Part D

;; Finally, write a function called `average-pothole`, which consumes a
;; DriveData and returns the average diameter (in feet) of its potholes. It
;; should return a MaybeNumber, defined below, and if there are no potholes,
;; return #false.
;;
;; Note: do not use the built-in `length` function.

;; A MaybeNumber is one of:
;; - #false
;; - Number
;; Interpretation: a Number or #false, if the number is unknown/impossible.
(define MNF #false)
(define MN0 0)
(define MN10 10.0)
(define (mn-temp mn)
  (cond [(boolean? mn) ...]
        [(number? mn) (... mn ...)]))
