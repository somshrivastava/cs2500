;; Customer Research

;;! Problem 1

;; We've been asked to assist with filtering a large set of market research data to identify
;; potential customers for a clothing brand. We've been given records in the following format:

(define-struct customer [age zip-code yearly-income next-customer])
;;! A Spreadsheet is one of:
;;! - "end of spreadsheet"
;;! - (make-customer Number Number Number Spreadsheet)
;;! Interpretation: a spreadsheet of results from a market research survey

(define (spreadsheet-template s)
  (cond
    [(and (string? s) (string=? s "end of spreadsheet")) ...]
    [else
     (... (customer-age s) ...
          (customer-zip-code s) ...
          (customer-yearly-income s) ...
          (spreadsheet-template (customer-next-customer s)) ...)]))

(define SS-EX-1 "end of spreadsheet")
(define SS-EX-2 (make-customer 25 02101 500000 SS-EX-1))
(define SS-EX-3 (make-customer 30 02110 75000 SS-EX-2))

;;! Part A

;; Write two more examples below.

;; Estimated Portion of Lab: 20%


;;! Part B

;; Design a function young-customers that takes a Spreadsheet and returns a Spreadsheet
;; containing only the customers who are under 30 years old.

;; Estimated Portion of Lab: 30%


;; STOP, SUBMIT YOUR WORK SO FAR TO GRADESCOPE, AND SWITCH WHO IS TYPING.

;;! Part C

;; INTERPRETIVE QUESTIONS
;; Imagine a political action group wants to share advertisements on YouTube with voters of
;; a certain political party. Although YouTube users don't explicitly share their political
;; affiliation, YouTube could feasibly analyze a user's watch history to determine their
;; political affiliation and target ads accordingly.

;; This is the idea of data inference: using one or many pieces of information to infer some
;; other piece of information. Data inference tools are being marketed for hiring employees,
;; detecting shoppers' moods, and predicting criminal behavior
;; (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/opinion/computational-inference.html).

;; Carefully consider our customer data. What might we be able to infer about our users with this data?
;; In 2-3 sentences, explain how that assumption could be problematic.
;; Estimated Portion of Lab: 20%


;;! Part D

;; Write a function, `total-fen/ken-income`, that takes in a Spreadsheet and produces
;; the total sum of incomes of customers who live in the Fenway and Kenmore neighborhoods
;; (zip codes 02115 and 02214).

;; Estimated Portion of Lab: 30%
