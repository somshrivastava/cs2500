;;!    parts to facilitate grading.
;;! 3. Any time you see the word "design", it means follow the appropriate
;;!    design recipe (function or data).

;;! Problem 1

;; TODO: Design the function string-starts-with? which takes two
;; Strings and returns a Boolean indicating whether the first
;; string begins with the second. Be sure to follow all the steps
;; of the Design Recipe for functions.

;; When you are testing your function, make sure you test the case
;; where the first string is shorter than the second. For example
;; (string-starts-with? "fundies" "fun") should return #true but
;; (string-starts-with? "fun" "fundies") should return #false.


;; STOP AND SWITCH PARTNERS!

;; Make sure you share your Problem 1 code with your partner before switching.


;;! Problem 2

;; You are running a robot portrait studio where artists can come to draw robot
;; models, but the problem is that the robot models keep falling asleep! In this lab,
;; you will design a simulator that allows you to wake the robots up when they
;; fall asleep, so your artists stop getting mad at you...
;;
;; - A robot can either be asleep or awake. Your program state will be able to
;;   represent these two states.
;;
;; - The user can wake up an asleep robot by pressing the "w"
;;   key on their keyboard.
;;
;; - Unfortunately, robots are prone to falling asleep: every 5 seconds, it seems
;;   that some process inside the robots causes them to fall asleep, even if they
;;   were just woken up!


;;! An RobotState is one of:
;;! - "asleep"
;;! - "awake"
;;! Interpretation: states of a robot in the portrait studio

;;! Part A

;; TODO: finish the Design Recipe for data for RobotState
;; (so provide examples and a template called rs-temp)


;;! Part B

;; In this part, you will define the two faces of your robot. We have provided
;; the sleeping face as the constant ASLEEP-FACE. You should design a face for
;; the woken up robot (who might be surprised, unhappy, or simply alert!) with
;; the constant AWAKE-FACE. You're welcome to re-use or modify our face components.

;; TODO: define constant AWAKE-FACE with an image with an awake robot.


;;! Part C
;;
;; Design a function, robot-draw, that takes a RobotState and produces an Image,
;; where the robot is either asleep or awake depending on the state.


;;! Part D
;;
;; Design a function, robot-key, that takes a RobotState and a KeyEvent, and when
;; the key 'w' is pressed, if the RobotState is ASLEEP, changes it to AWAKE. If
;; any other key is pressed, the state should not change.


;;! Part E
;;
;; Design a function, robot-tick, that takes a RobotState and, if it is AWAKE, makes
;; it ASLEEP again.


;;! Part F
;;
;; Design a function robot-studio-simulator (but do not write check-expects)
;; that calls big-bang with all the handlers above, given a starting state
;; as input. Note that for `on-tick`, you will want to include the optional second
;; argument that is the time interval between when it is called.


;; To test your simulator, run (robot-studio-simulator ASLEEP) in the interactions
;; window. If you do put it that line in the definitions window, be SURE to comment
;; it out before submitting, as otherwise your program will run forever and the
;; autograder will be unable to process it.
